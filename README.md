# 3 Tier AWS Project

This project is a full-stack web application built using React js for the frontend, Express js for the backend, and MySQL as the database. The application is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a 3-tier architecture, where the presentation layer (React js), application logic layer (Express js), and data layer (MySQL) are separated into distinct tiers.

## STEP 1: Setting up Application Tier

## STEP 2: Setting up the Data Tier
#### Install MySQL

1. Create RDS MySQL Database by selecting the Free Tier option and set the password
   Ensure to store the password, to later configure in Application Tier
   
2. To Install MySQL mysql cli package:

```bash
sudo yum install -y mariadb
```

3. To verify the package is installed:

```bash
which mysql
```

4. Login to MySQL CLI, replace the RDS Host and username from the RDS Console, password will be asked on prompt

```bash
mysql -h <RDS Host> -P 3306 -u <username> -p
```

5. Once successfully logged in, you will see the below message

```bash
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 9738
Server version: 8.0.28 Source distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql>
```

3. Run each commands in the MQSQL:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE react_node_app; 
CREATE USER 'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'learnIT02#'; 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON react_node_app.* TO ' appuser'@'%'; 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

CREATE TABLE `author` ( 
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL, 
  `birthday` date NOT NULL, 
  `bio` text NOT NULL, 
  `createdAt` date NOT NULL, 
  `updatedAt` date NOT NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`) 
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=8 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

CREATE TABLE `book` ( 
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
  `title` varchar(255) NOT NULL, 
  `releaseDate` date NOT NULL, 
  `description` text NOT NULL, 
  `pages` int NOT NULL, 
  `createdAt` date NOT NULL, 
  `updatedAt` date NOT NULL, 
  `authorId` int DEFAULT NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`), 
  KEY `FK_66a4f0f47943a0d99c16ecf90b2` (`authorId`), 
  CONSTRAINT `FK_66a4f0f47943a0d99c16ecf90b2` FOREIGN KEY (`authorId`) REFERENCES `author` (`id`) 
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=10 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci; 
```

## STEP 3: Setting up the Presentation Tier

## Connecting to private EC2 instance via a bastion host
1. To change the ssh key permission:

```bash
chmod 400 your_key.pem
```

2. To start ssh agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"  
```

3. To add key to ssh agent:

```bash
ssh-add your_key.pem
```

4. To ssh into bastion host with agent forwarding:

5. To connect private instance from the bastion host:

```bash
ssh ec2-user@private_instance_private_ip 
```
